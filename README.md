# Cam2ASCII

This is not a serious project. I made it for fun.
The application transforms an image into ASCII. It takes several pictures in a row with the webcam. That's why it's not fluid, there is no video stream processing, only photos. I may later add a virtual camera to be able to use it on softwares like Discord, Zoom, Skype...
# Build
It use Qt 5 Open Source libraries. Nothing more (for now).
